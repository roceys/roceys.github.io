The results of the themes contest (https://t.me/contest/106) have finally arrived. We carefully inspected each of the 341 themes submitted by the 277 designers and selected the ones we considered best. While none of the themes submitted are perfect, here’s how we identified the winners:

1. Themes that supported more than 2 platforms were slightly prioritized.
2. Themes that could be built within a few minutes using the Telegram UI were discarded.
3. Themes that we deemed unusable (e.g. those with low contrast / dissonant color palettes) were likewise discarded.
